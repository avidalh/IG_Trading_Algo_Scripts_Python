# IG_Trading_Algo_Scripts_Python
IG Trading Algos and Scripts in Python

This project is a collection of my work over 2 years building IG Trading Algorithms + Scripts, and [Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=WAJRVR3TBB4FN) would be much appreciated.  

The Data Folder holds instrument data, raw and cleaned:
.csv files are intended to be used for pandas dataframes 

The algorithms follow a mvc format each controller calls a algorithm to run (some have been commented out)

Create a file holding your API keys and state its path in __predefined_functions -> initialisation.py__

### Just a few more notes:

The core scripts used in trading_IG (license in root folder) and some of the scripts in test and
the config are from: https://github.com/ig-python/ig-markets-api-python-library

**All the other scripts + algos have been developed by me.**

This project has a number of different algorithms, some had interesting results and others not so: The most interesting of those, Iâ€™ve documented in my videos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9i5Rvi8XLwE - Positions on opposite sides of a single instrument

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VO9KsEVHeBk - Opposite orders on a single instrument - before the market opens
