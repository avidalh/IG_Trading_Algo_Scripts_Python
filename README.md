# IG_Trading_Algo_Scripts_Python
IG Trading Algos and Scripts in Python

This project is a collection of my work over 2 years building IG Trading Algorithms + Scripts, and [Donations](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=WAJRVR3TBB4FN) would be much appreciated.  

The Data Folder holds instrument data, raw and cleaned:
.csv files are intended to be used for pandas dataframes 

The algorithms follow a mvc format each controller calls a algorithm to run (some have been commented out)

Create a file holding your API keys and state its path in __predefined_functions -> initialisation.py__

### **Some Algorithms had interesting results and others not so** - the interesting ones are stated below:
